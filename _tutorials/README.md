**Babelfish is a self-hosted server for source code parsing.** The Babelfish
service can parse any file, in any supported language, extract an ASTs (Abstract
Syntax Tree) from it, and convert it to a [**UAST**](./uast/specification.md)
(Universal Abstract Syntax Tree) which can enable further analysis and
transformation with the included or your own tools using an standard format.


## Motivation and Scope

Babelfish was born as a solution for massive code analysis. The goal: analyzing
all source code from every repository in the world, for every revision ever.

Current **scope is parsing single files in any programming language**
and producing a universal abstract syntax tree. This helps us to run it at scale.

This scope might expand in the future to full project analysis, where source code
can be analyzed with its full context, an not just per-file. Once we get closer to
our current scope, we may consider starting such effort.

## Use Cases

Some of the use cases that we want to support with AST are:

* **AST-based diff'ing.** Understanding changes made to code with finer-grained
  granularity. Is this commit changing variable names? Is it adding a loop?
* **Import extraction.** Extracting all imports from every language in a uniform
  way.
* **Extract representation for Data Science experiments.** For example, extracting
  a list of all tokens for every file, or a list of all function calls, etc.
* **Making statistics of language features.** How many people uses
  for-comprehension in Python?
* **Detecting similar coding patterns across languages.**
* **Programmer-asisting tools** Improved linters, safety analysis, idiomatic
  usage, etc.
