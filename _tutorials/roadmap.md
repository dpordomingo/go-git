# Roadmap

We are still defining a detailed roadmap! But our short term plans are:

1. Evolve UAST specification until a point where we can use it to do some relevant
  analysis.
2. Have [Python](https://github.com/bblfsh/python-driver) and [Java](https://github.com/bblfsh/java-driver/) drivers fully implemented.
3. Create a client library to work with Babelfish Protocol and UAST (_[bblfsh/libuast](https://github.com/bblfsh/libuast)_)
4. Create client library bindings for [Go](https://github.com/bblfsh/client-go), [Scala](https://github.com/bblfsh/client-scala) and [Python](https://github.com/bblfsh/client-python).
3. Write drivers for top N languages.
4. Write drivers for a few languages of different paradigms that help us to improve
   UAST definition.
